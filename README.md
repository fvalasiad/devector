# devector
Header-only Double ended vector implementation similar to STL's std::vector for efficient insertions/removals at both the start  &amp; end of it.

**Still under development**

Feel free to contribute and/or report bugs.

A detailed usage guide will be released eventually, but for the most part the interface is the same as std::vector's, you should feel right at home.
